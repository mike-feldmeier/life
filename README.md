## Conway's Game of Life

**Warning:** This is not meant to be a *good* implementation of Life.  It is just a playground project to try some different approaches in React.

Feel free to take a look, get some ideas on what to do, most likely more ideas on what not to do.

## Hosted Demo
There is a demo of this code hosted on [Github Pages](https://mike-feldmeier.github.io/life)
